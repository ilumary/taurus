\begin{itemize}
 \item Variable Sized Integer \label{variable_sized_integer}
 \item Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) \label{ecn}
 \item ACK Range. An ACK range specifies a continuous sequence of packets that have been successfully received by the receiver. When a receiver acknowledges data, it doesn't necessarily need to acknowledge each packet individually. Instead, it can efficiently transmit an ACK with a range, indicating that it has received all packets within that range, from a starting point to an ending point. \label{ack_range}
 \item Connection Identifier (cid) Uses Source and Destination cids. scid and dcid change switch between two endpoints\label{cid}
 \item ClientHello
